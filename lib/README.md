## ðŸŽ¨ What makes this library awesome?

- **Atomic Design Magic**: Bringing a science concept to reality - atoms. See how tiny atom transform into molecules and then into full-blown organisms to create UI masterpieces!
- **Theme Switching Superpowers**: Flip between light and dark themes with a single click. Like magic!
- **Responsive Goodness**: Components that adapt faster than a chameleon.
- **Accessibility Champion**: Because everyone deserves a great user experience, no exceptions!
- **Customization Paradise**: Tweak and tune to make these components truly yours.
- **TypeScript + React**: Typings that makes your IDE happy and your bugs sad.
- **Vite-powered**: Lightning-fast builds.
- **Styled Components**: Scoped CSS-in-JS.
- **Storybook Wonderland**: An interactive playground where components come to life.
- **Testing Confidence**: Some tests that let you sleep peacefully at night.

## ðŸ“š Component Hierarchy (It's Like a UI Family Tree!)

We've embraced the **Atomic Design Principle** - it's not just a methodology, it's a way of life:

* **Atoms** (basic building blocks of UI)

  * Funky SVG icons that bring personality to UI!

* **Molecules** (groupings of atoms)

  * Expandable content sections that provide interactive visibility control with various styling options and custom icons.

## ðŸ“¦ Add Some Spice to Your Project!

Install our delightful package:

```bash
npm install @shubham_chauhan/component-lib
```

Import and use components (it's simple):

```js
import { Accordion, ExpandablePanel, Icon } from '@shubham_chauhan/component-lib';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Accordion
    allowMultipleOpen={true}
    panelVariant="PRIMARY"
    items={[{
